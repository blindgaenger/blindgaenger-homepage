## Buzzword bingo

Don't like playing bingo, so just have a look at the `Gemfile` to find out which ruby libraries I'm using.

Notable JavaScript stuff is [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/) for drawing the icon at the bottom right.

And I officially *tried* to use HTML5 and CSS3 correctly. But to be honest, currently it's more like a playground to me. No holds barred!

    <!--[if lt IE 7]>SORRY!<![endif]-->

Apart from that, I still love [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) for hosting.
