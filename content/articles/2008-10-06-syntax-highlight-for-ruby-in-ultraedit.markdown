[UltraEdit](http://www.ultraedit.com/) provides a ruby wordfile at [ftp://www.ultraedit.com/wf/ruby.txt](ftp://www.ultraedit.com/wf/ruby.txt)

Download the wordfile and include its contents into your UltraEdit wordfile.txt 
By default, this file is at `C:\Program Files\UltraEdit-32\wordlist.txt`. Open 
it easily by clicking `Advanced > Configuration > Editor Display > Syntax Highlighting > Open`.

Append the contents of `ruby.txt` from above to the newly opened `wordlist.txt`. 
Save and close `wordlist.txt`. Now, Ruby should be an option under 
`View > View As(Highlighting File Type`.

Enjoy!
