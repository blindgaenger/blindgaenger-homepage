My new blog, nothing special. I want to keep it DRY, so check out my
[Homepage](http://blindgaenger.net "blindgaenger.net") if you want to know more
about me. I could bore you by trying to explain why I set up this blog. And that
I know what I want to write about, or that I don't know yet ... but I don't feel
like it today.

$ git checkout blog
