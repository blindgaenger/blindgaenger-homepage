Alright, I've just added a tag cloud to the [Tags tab](/tags/). As long as I don't have an online search, I've to improve the navigation at least. And I hate to scroll when I want to find one of my posts!

This is an interesting article about [Choosing a good font size variation algorithm for your tag cloud](http://blogs.dekoh.com/dev/2007/10/29/choosing-a-good-font-size-variation-algorithm-for-your-tag-cloud/). Yep, the title explains it all. So I've tried the *Logarithmic mapping* to compute the font-sizes in the cloud. Looks very nice!
